# Linear-Equation-From-2-Points
A simple program to create linear equation from 2 points.
## Features
- This program is designed to work for most graphing calculators (ex. Desmos, GeoGebra)
- This program works by arranging the numbers, NOT calculating them therefore this is not suitable for on-paper calculation as the result might be confusing for humans.
